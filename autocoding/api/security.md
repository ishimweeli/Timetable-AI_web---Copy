# API Security Implementation

## Authentication

### JWT Implementation
- **Token Structure**:
    - Header: Algorithm and token type
    - Payload: User ID, roles, organization ID, expiration time
    - Signature: Encrypted with server's secret key
- **Token Lifetime**:
    - Access Token: 1 hour
    - Refresh Token: 2 weeks
- **Token Storage**:
    - Client-side: HTTP-only secure cookies
    - Server-side: Redis for token blacklisting

### OAuth2 Providers
- Google
- Facebook
- Apple ID

### Password Security
- Stored using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
- Password complexity requirements:
    - Minimum 8 characters
    - Must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts for 15 minutes

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Predefined Roles**:
    - Admin
    - Manager
    - Sub-Manager/Editor
    - Teacher
    - Student
- Custom role creation for organization-specific needs

### Permission Structure
- Entity-based permissions (e.g., create:teacher, read:timetable)
- Organization-scoped permissions
- Audit logging for all permission checks

## Security Best Practices

### API Rate Limiting
- General endpoints: 100 requests per minute
- Authentication endpoints: 10 requests per minute

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization and schema validation
- Parameter type checking and validation

### HTTPS Only
- Secure cookies, HSTS headers
- TLS 1.2+ required for all communications

### Logging and Monitoring
- Audit logs for sensitive operations
- Failed login attempt monitoring
- Real-time security alerts for suspicious activities
