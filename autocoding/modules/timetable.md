# Timetable Module

## Overview
The Timetable Module is the core component for AI-based scheduling, generating optimized schedules while considering teacher availability, student load, and room constraints.

## Key Features
- AI-powered schedule optimization
- Constraint-based timetable generation
- Conflict resolution algorithms
- Schedule visualization and export

## Files & Tools
- **Create timetable**: Generate new schedules
- **Import CSV file**: Load external timetable data
- **Export CSV file**: Share timetable information
- **Print**: Generate printable timetables
- **Undo**: Revert recent changes
- **Search and replace**: Find and modify timetable elements
    - Fields to search: Teacher, Class, Room, Period, Module Size, Binding status
    - Fields to replace with: Teacher, Class, Subject, Room, Rule, Period

## Timetable Generation Process
1. Define all constraints (teachers, rooms, subjects, classes)
2. Set scheduling rules and preferences
3. Run AI optimization algorithm
4. Review generated timetable
5. Make manual adjustments if needed
6. Finalize and publish timetable

## AI Optimization Features
- Teacher workload balancing
- Room utilization optimization
- Subject distribution according to pedagogical principles
- Student workload consideration
- Conflict minimization

## Integration Points
- Teacher Module: Teacher availability and preferences
- Room Module: Room availability constraints
- Subject Module: Subject scheduling rules
- Class Module: Class scheduling requirements
- Rule Module: Custom scheduling constraints
